<h1>Me and my cats</h1>
</header>
<main class="about">
    <p>Hi! My name is Michalina and my little family consists of my husband, me and our two cats- Jinx (Russian Blue) en Elsa (Ragdoll). 
        We got Jinx after we got married in 2016 and Elsa joined us one year later.   </p>
    <p>At first we didn't have a lot of expirience with cats. I had always had dogs and Bart, my husband, didn't have any pets. As first time cat owners we had to do a lot of reading about cats in general and also about the two specific breeds.
        That's actually the reason why I decided to make this website, so that other first-time owners can find all the important information about these lovely cats. 
    </p>
    <h2>A few words about Elsa en Jinx</h2>
    <h3>Jinx</h3>
    <p>Jinx is a very shy and lovely cat. He doesn't like strangers and escapes the moment he hears someone coming in. To us he is the most loving and loyal companion. 
        He loves to be pet, belly rubs are his favouirite and he can lay on the desk of my husband for hours.</p>
        <p>Jinx is a champion with a pedigree going back 6 generations. You can say he is a perfect Russian Blue. He is a true aristo-cat, usually not concerned with playfull Elsa's attempts to chase him. 
            Once agiteted however, he tends to play along. </p>

    <h3>Elsa</h3>
<p>Elsa is a true princess, gets angry when something goes diffrent than she wants. A very playfull en funny true diva! I read once that Ragdolls don't jump but we soon learned that's not the case with our Elsa. Once she is in our garden it's almost impossible to keep her there. 
    The moment you turn your head around she tries to jump over the fence to our neighbours. </p>
    <p>Even though she doesn't have a pedigree I think she is a good representative of the breed. Her beautiful coat needs brushing at least once a week, more often when shedding in the spring. One look in her beautiful blue eyes makes youn fall in love with her instantly</p>
    <p>Elsa is a lovely lady with a character. She loves to lay be my side when I'm reading on the couch and is always first to greet me when I'm home. It't also hilarious to watch her play with a small ball on her own- she trows the ball of the stairs and chases it. 
        She really loves to play.</p>
